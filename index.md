<h2 class="blackpar_title"> New Frontiers in Summarization Workshops </h2>
<h3 class="blackpar_title">NewSumm</h3>
  
The goal for this workshop series is to provide a research forum for cross-fertilization of ideas. We seek to bring together researchers from a diverse range of fields (e.g., summarization, visualization, language generation, cognitive and psycholinguistics) for discussion on key issues related to automatic summarization. This includes discussion on novel paradigms/frameworks, shared tasks of interest, information integration and presentation, applied research and applications, and possible future research foci. The workshop will pave the way towards building a cohesive research community, accelerating knowledge diffusion, developing new tools, datasets and resources that are in line with the needs of academia, industry, and government.
