<h2 class="blackpar_title"> New Frontiers in Summarization Workshop </h2>
<h3 class="blackpar_title">The Third NewSum Workshop </h3>
</center>
<p>
The Third Workshop on “New Frontiers in Summarization workshop” aims to provide a research forum for cross-fertilization of ideas in automatic summarization and related areas. This includes discussion on novel paradigms/frameworks, shared tasks of interest, information integration and presentation, applied research and applications, and possible future research foci. The workshop will pave the way towards building a cohesive research community, accelerating knowledge diffusion, developing new tools, datasets and resources that are in line with the needs of academia, industry, and government.

<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="Overview">Overview</h2>

New advances in natural language processing (e.g., pre-trained models with self-supervised objectives) have resulted in state-of-the-art performance according to existing standards of summarization evaluation, by effectively exploiting large-scale datasets and superior computing power. This progress now needs to be complemented in at least two ways. On the one hand, the summarization of large amounts of multimodal data (text + others) needs more sophisticated abstraction capabilities, better integration of abstraction and extraction, more flexible language generation, as well as the ability to combine language with information visualization. On the other hand, to assess the quality of such system summaries, more comprehensive evaluation metrics are needed which correlate more tightly with human judges or extrinsic task-based performance. For example, an important research topic which has emerged in the past two years is to ensure that the output summarization is factually consistent with the source text (Kryscinski et al., 2019), which has resulted in new summarization evaluation techniques focused on correctness. Both of these pillars will be crucial for realistic, ecologically valid deployment of summarization research. 
 
The goal for this workshop is to provide a research forum for cross-fertilization of ideas. We seek to bring together researchers from a diverse range of fields (e.g., summarization, visualization, language generation, cognitive and psycholinguistics) for discussion on key issues related to automatic summarization. This includes discussion on novel paradigms/frameworks, shared tasks of interest, information integration and presentation, applied research and applications, and possible future research foci. The workshop will pave the way towards building a cohesive research community, accelerating knowledge diffusion, developing new tools, datasets and resources that are in line with the needs of academia, industry, and government

<br><br>
<h2 class="blackpar_title">Submission Instructions</h2>


You are invited to submit your papers in our <a href='https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/Summarization/'>START/SoftConf submission portal</a>. All the submitted papers have to be anonymous for double-blind review. The content of the paper should not be longer than 8 pages for long papers and 4 pages for short papers, strictly following the <a href='https://2021.emnlp.org/call-for-papers/style-and-formatting'>EMNLP 2021 style templates</a>. Supplementary and appendices (either as separate files or appended after the main submission) are allowed. We encourage code link submissions for the camera-ready version.

  
NewSum 2021 will allow double submission as long as the authors make a decision before camera-ready. We will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to NewSum 2021 must ensure that their submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results. Authors can submit up to 100 MB of supplementary materials separately. Authors are highly encouraged to submit their codes for reproducibility purposes.
